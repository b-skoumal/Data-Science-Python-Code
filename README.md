# Introduction to Data Science - Labs
Course website: [http://datasciencecourse.net](http://datasciencecourse.net)

This repository will contain directories with all labs. You can manually download the files for each homework, but we recommend that you use git to clone and update this repository. 

You can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to update this repository as new homeworks are published, or you can use the following commands: 

## Initial Step: Cloning

When you clone a repository you set up a copy on your computer. Run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datascience-course/2016-datascience-labs
```

This will create a folder `2016-datascience-labs` on your computer, with the individual labs in subdirectories. 

## Updating

As we release new homeworks, or if we discover mistakes and update an already released lab, you'll have to update your repository. You can do this by changing into the `2016-datascience-labs` directory and executing: 

```bash
git pull
```

That's it - you'll have the latest version of the labs.
